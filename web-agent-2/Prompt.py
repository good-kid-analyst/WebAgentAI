Analyse the answers given by {google_analysis} and {reddit_analysis} and formulate an answer to the question {user_question}.

User Question:
{user_question}
"""

reflection_instructions = """
You are an expert research assistant analyzing summaries about "{user_question}".

Instructions:
- Identify knowledge gaps or areas that need deeper exploration and generate a follow-up query. (1 or multiple).
- If provided summaries are sufficient to answer the user's question, don't generate a follow-up query.
- If there is a knowledge gap, generate a follow-up query that would help expand your understanding.
- Focus on technical details, implementation specifics, or emerging trends that weren't fully covered.

Requirements:
- Ensure the follow-up query is self-contained and includes necessary context for web search.

Output Format:
- Format your response as a JSON object with these exact keys:
   - "is_sufficient": true or false
   - "knowledge_gap": Describe what information is missing or needs clarification
   - "follow_up_queries": Write a specific question to address this gap

Example:
```json
{{
    "is_sufficient": true, // or false
    "knowledge_gap": "The summary lacks information about performance metrics and benchmarks", // "" if is_sufficient is true
    "follow_up_queries": ["What are typical performance benchmarks and metrics used to evaluate [specific technology]?"] // [] if is_sufficient is true
}}
```

Reflect carefully on the Summaries to identify knowledge gaps and produce a follow-up query. Then, produce your output following this JSON format:

Summaries:
